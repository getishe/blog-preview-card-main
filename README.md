## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- MdN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For fonts

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout for the blog preview card. I also learned how to use media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about CSS Grid and Flexbox to create more complex layouts. I also want to learn more about responsive design and how to create components that work well on different screen sizes.
I plan to practice these skills by building more projects and experimenting with different layouts.
I also want to learn more about accessibility and how to make my components more accessible to users with disabilities.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand how to use Flexbox for layout. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [MdN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me choose the right fonts for my project. I really liked the variety of fonts available and will use it going forward.
